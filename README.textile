h2. FAQ

Q: Why not using the built in tumblr feed importer ?
A: It's limited to 5 feeds
   It's slow (updates every hours at best)
   You can't import every feed to any post type
   You can't customize which feed data goes to which tumblr

Q: Can I use this tool with another blog than my default one (other than the primary one)?
A: No. Unfortunately the tumblr API doesn't allow that for now.
